# No Skill Drain

Simple project to allow disabling skill drain on death. 
This does the exact same as if you would die twice within 
short period of time, where also no skill drain is active 
as a buf. The difference is that this mod doesn't need 
the buff active, but will just adjust the skill lowering 
on death.
